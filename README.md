# Identity Service Project

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive identity and access management system, handling entities such as Users, Roles, Permissions, and Access Controls within an application. The system is designed to be flexible, extensible, and easy to integrate into existing infrastructures.

## Tech Stack

- **.NET 8**: The core framework used for building the application, leveraging its latest features like minimal APIs, dependency injection, and improved performance.
- **Entity Framework Core**: For data access, providing an ORM for efficient database operations and easy-to-use LINQ queries.
- **SQL Server**: The primary database for storing user information, roles, permissions, and other related data.
- **Dependency Injection (DI)**: Managed by .NET's built-in DI framework, allowing for flexible and decoupled architecture.
- **Logging**: Utilizes .NET's logging extensions for consistent and configurable logging across the application.

## Key Features

1. **User Management**: CRUD operations for managing users, including assigning roles and setting access permissions.
2. **Role Management**: Create, update, and manage roles within the system, defining what actions users with these roles can perform.
3. **Access Control**: Fine-grained control over user permissions, including the ability to view, edit, delete, or create resources.
4. **Entities and Services**: A robust structure with clear separation of concerns, using interfaces and services to manage each entity.

## Project Structure

- **Entities**: Define the core data structures, such as User, Role, UserRole, App, AppPage, and others.
- **Services**: Contain the business logic for handling entities, implemented through interfaces like `IUserService`, `IRoleService`, etc.
- **Repositories**: Abstract data access logic, providing a clean interface for querying and modifying the database.
- **Controllers** (if applicable): Handle HTTP requests and route them to the appropriate service methods.
